# BuildNotes

A lightweight in-game note-taking and build-tracking mod for Minecraft (Fabric).

- Create, edit, and delete notes directly in-game.  
- Mark notes as **Global** (visible in any world) or **Per-World** (visible only in the current world).   
- Future planned update: **Server-side support** with permission controls for admins.
